# MathJax Gutenberg Block

> This plugin is very early in the development stage and is unstable, and very well may break your site if you install it. For now if you're interested in this plugin your best bet is probably just to star it so you can keep up to date when it's updated to a working version. 

Gutenberg block for WordPress that allows you to embed an image created by MathJax.

Yes, these exist but they all use the MathJax JavaScript library on client side. The goal for this is to allow you to easily create equations in posts and have them displayed as static images client side so you don't have to load the MathJax JavaScript library for your visitors.
